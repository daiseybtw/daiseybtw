### Hi there 👋

I'm Daisey,

I like to get involved with cloud architecture, software engineering, technology in general and writing. I'm also way to involved with podcasts, in fact I've always wanted to start one!

I love to try new things so please reach out and recommend some new coffee blends or food!
